Files Required:

    HTML File - 1
    CSS File - 1
    JS File - 1

Timeline:

    One Week

Fields:

    First name:  ________________
    Last name :  ________________
    Email id  :  ________________
    DOB       :  ________________

Map:

1)Create HTML file.
2)Create External CSS file for styling the Form.
3)Link the External CSS file to the HTML file.
4)Create JS file for Validating the fiels using OOPS Concepts.

Pseudocode:

HTML File ==>
   Create a html tag
   Create a body tag
   Create a form inside the body tag 
   Create a div class for First name
   Create a div class for Last name  
   Create a div class for Email id
   Create a div class for DOB
  Link ==>
    Link the External Css file using link tag and href attribute which saved as .css file.
    Link the Javascript file using Script tag and src attribute which saved as .js file.
  Button class ==>
    Submit button
 close the div tag
 close the form tag
 close the body tag
 close the html tag

CSS File ==>
 style the html file using the different style attributes.
 Then store it as .css file as external file and link it to the html file.

JAVASCRIPT File ==>
  JS is used to validate all the fields
    ==>First name should contain only the alphabets.
    ==>Last name should contain only the alphabets.
    ==>Email id should be a valid one it done by using regex.
    ==>Date of birth should not be in future.
 These are the requirements that the field should be valid.
 If the all the fields are valid then submit button will be enabled and we can complete our process of form validation.
 The form validation in Javascript is done by using OOPS CONCEPTS such as class,objects,methods,etc..
